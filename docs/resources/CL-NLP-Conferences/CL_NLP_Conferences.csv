While 195 papers received some kind of ethics review, 110 were found to fit in a set of common categories of issues;  to help reduce reviewer workload, EACs used boilerplate review text for these common situations. A situation arose where a paper was rejected by an AC in the regular review process for ethical reasons. PCs asked EACs to weigh in, and we elected to defer to the ACs in doing so (i.e., not to set precedent that the only way papers can be rejected for ethics concerns is via the ethics review process)"
