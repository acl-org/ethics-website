### How to run your own tutorial or lesson?

We recommend using our base materials here and adapting them to your setting.  Minimally, you need to create your own shortlinks and URL codes to your version of the materials before running, as the archived materials reference our ACL 2025 or EACL 2023 instances.

For our tutorial setting in an audience participatory style and approximately 20+ participants and 4 organisers, it was important to:

* Restrict the number of groups so that each group can present within the session's time limit;

* Designate a particular organiser to facilitate virtual participants;

* Have live edit access to online documents, to allow participant leads to note-take and present.

Other formats might consider:

* Lecture only: use and adapt the lecture materials from the first and seventh segments of the tutorial.

* Experiential only: use and adapt Segments 2–6, which asks participants to read and critique abstracts that bring up common ethical issues in our community.

* Student (Homework) Assignment: curate sources from the accompanying Ethics Reading List that the committee maintains, and ask participants to read and write their reflections on.

**If you run a course, tutorial or other session based on these materials, we'd love to hear from you! Please get in contact with us, and we may also (with your permission) list your course or materials in the [Resource](#r) segment.  Also please do cite our tutorial abstract as a means of acknowledging the helpfulness of the materials.  Thank you!**

This tutorial will equip participants with basic guidelines for thinking deeply about ethical issues and review common considerations that recur in NLP research. The methodology is interactive and participatory, including discussion of case studies and group work. Participants will gain practical experience on when to flag a paper for ethics review and how to write an ethical consideration section to be shared with the broader community. Most importantly, the participants will be co-creating the tutorial outcomes and extending tutorial materials to share as public outcomes."

### <a id="i">Introduction</a>

In 2024, the ACL Ethics Committee (AEC) decided to propose to run a tutorial on ethics and its impact on ethics in both authoring and reviewing aspects for the community of CL/NLP scholars and practitioners.  As part of this process, the AEC Committee put together the [proposal file](https://github.com/acl-org/ethics-website/blob/main/docs/tutorials/Ethics_Tutorial_Proposal__ACL_2025.pdf) and submitted it to the joint call for tutorial proposals. It is currently published in the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-tutorials.5/).

The tutorial was accepted to run at [ACL 2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/) (Vienna, Austria, 27 July to 1 August) on Sundey, 27 July from 14:00 to 17:30hs in Hall M.1-M.2 at the venue. The tutorial will be hybrid and we will have online moderators for the virtual participants. 

The tutorial and its materials will be presented in English.  It will be structured as per the proposal, in seven segments, each approximately 30 minutes long.  It is participatory in nature, requiring the audience to work in groups on invented problematic abstracts written by the proposers that represent common ethical issues experienced by ethics review chairs.  There will be a good facilitator-to-group ratio, to ensure all of the participants have a chance to reflect, contribute and be heard, and for the facilitators to keep the session on track.

</div>

We conducted the tutorial in an active classroom style, where participants were self-organized into small groups (in our instance, 2 groups of about 10 participants each), electing leads for subsequent group presentation and worked through the exercises to record their reactions to the materials and identify the issues and conducive outcomes.

### <a id="a">Activity</a>

The hands-on activity in the tutorial starts with a 5-minute introduction of the activity and a short review of the individual abstracts, which are also described in the slides.  Participants were grouped into random groups, which had to elect a scribe and a presenter.  The scribe serves as a secretariat for typing in the notes from their group; and the presenter is delegated as the person in the group to present the findings to the entire tutorial audience.  Each group was assigned one of the abstracts to read and critique.

The critique of the abstracts is run in two phases.  In the first phase, groups discuss first to prepare a single slide for silent sharing with other groups (Segment 2).  In this second phase (Segment 4), the groups could enlarge their thinking by reflecting on either additional abstracts, the single shared slide from each group, or both.

After both phases were finished, each group presented elements of their findings, with the faciltators structuring and probing for issues and clarity on different aspects.  

#### Materials

The activity was run using a scribe document where the organizers communicated information (the abstracts below and the instructions) and solicited the audience's feedback on the overall session.

However, for the group activities, we used an editable online presentation deck such that each group could create 1-3 slides (1 slide max in the first phease) in their respective subgroups.

We provide 9 abstracts below with a gloss of their topical concern. The first 6 were written for EACL 2023, but only the first three were ran, due to the smaller number of participants.

* The ACL Ethics Stakeholder Survey - Prior to the tutorial, the AEC also conducted a survey of our ACL stakeholders, to help priortize ethics needs of our community.  This tutorial is a direct result of that mandate presented live at ACL (Toronto, Canada) on 11 July 2023.
