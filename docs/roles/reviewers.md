As a reviewer or prospective reviewer, perhaps you are unsure what constitutes an appropriate use for flagging a paper for further ethics review. Perhaps you also want to learn how to contribute to the process of assessing papers for ethical issues. Weâ€™ll show you how to best use the author-provided responsible research checklist as a basis for starting your assessment, and also how to test your own knowledge of ethics through case studies and simulated reviewing.

Ethics reviewing is arguably one of the most important contributions we as a community can do for the long-term health of our field. Right now, we are sorely lacking in enough manpower to do all the reviewing we would ideally want to do. By completing these self-guided exercises, we hope that you will volunteer to the pool of qualified ethical reviewers to help make scalable ethics reviewing a reality. You can find case studies in the [Tutorial](https://ethics.aclweb.org/tutorials/) resources, and a detailed recommendations document (Ethical Review Recommendations Section) in the [Resource](https://ethics.aclweb.org/resources/) section.
