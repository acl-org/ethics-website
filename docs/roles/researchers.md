* [responsible research checklist](https://aclrollingreview.org/static/responsibleNLPresearch.pdf): This checklist should be part of every scientific project in the domain of CL/NLP and should be the first point of reference if you come up with an interesting research question – even before you start working on it. Throughout the project, the checklist guides you to keep in mind questions of responsible research. Added benefit: On submission of your paper it is already filled in and you don’t have to think about what you decided several weeks or months ago. See here how this can be put into practice.
