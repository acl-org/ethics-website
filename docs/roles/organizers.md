Organizers and convenors of community events carry heightened ethical responsibilities, especially as NLP systems move into production and everyday use. They must set and enforce clear standards for submissions and presentations, including requirements on data provenance and consent, privacy protections, bias and fairness assessment, safety and red‑teaming, environmental impact reporting, and disclosure of funding, conflicts of interest, and potential dual‑use risks. 

They should ensure accessibility and inclusion, provide channels for community feedback and harm reporting, and require authors to articulate real‑world impacts, mitigation plans, and limits of generalization. By embedding ethics into calls for papers, reviewing rubrics, speaker guidelines, and on‑site practices, organizers shape a culture of accountability that protects participants, affected communities, and the broader public.

Below, we outline considerations for **prospective organizers** planning workshops or conferences, followed by timelines and logistics for **organizers** executing the event.

# Prospective Organizers 

## 1. Ensure Appropriate Gender, Geographic and Cultural balance

* Scientific events often feature plenary talks and panels where speakers are seen as representing the community or stakeholder perspectives. Aim for balanced representation, especially in plenaries and keynotes across multiple days.
* Panels should include diverse and, where appropriate, opposing viewpoints to enrich discussion.
Budget extra time and resources to identify, invite, and support underrepresented voices (e.g., travel support, remote participation options, childcare). Appoint a *Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion* (DEI) chair to coordinate with sponsorship leads to enable these accommodations.

## 2. Reserve Sufficient Time for Ethical Review
* Ethical and scientific reviews should be given comparable attention and time. Ensure your reviewing timeline explicitly includes adequate time for ethics review, not just technical evaluation.
* See [Recommendations for Conference Chairs](../resources/ethical-review-recommendations/index.md#2-recommendations-for-conference-chairs) has a full rundown of the timeline; review it even before submitting your proposal. 
* Engage us as the current [ACL Ethics Committee](../../commiitee/) early to help seed your ethics reviewer pool and to advise on review criteria and triage processes.

## 3. Signal that ethics is a first-order priority
* Event webpages and calls for papers (CFPs) should clearly communicate ethical expectations and review policies. Include explicit ethics sections in CFPs, submission checklists, and reviewer guidelines.
* Publicly list the officers responsible for ethics (e.g., Ethics Chair, DEI Chair) and provide a contact channel for concerns, harm reports, and requests for guidance.
* Reinforce ethical commitments in author instructions, speaker agreements, and session moderation guidelines, and highlight them during opening remarks and author briefings.
