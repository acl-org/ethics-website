Organizers and convenors of community events carry heightened ethical responsibilities, especially as NLP systems move into production and everyday use. They must set and enforce clear standards for submissions and presentations, including requirements on data provenance and consent, privacy protections, bias and fairness assessment, safety and red‑teaming, environmental impact reporting, and disclosure of funding, conflicts of interest, and potential dual‑use risks. They should ensure accessibility and inclusion, provide channels for community feedback and harm reporting, and require authors to articulate real‑world impacts, mitigation plans, and limits of generalization. By embedding ethics into calls for papers, reviewing rubrics, speaker guidelines, and on‑site practices, organizers shape a culture of accountability that protects participants, affected communities, and the broader public.

In the below, we'll go into considerations that **prospective organizers** should account for when planning an event, such as a workshop or conference, then cover specific timelines for **organizers**, who will be concerned about the logistics and organization timelines associated with actual activities.

# Prospective Organizers 

## 1. Consider appropriate gender, geographic and cultural balance

In a scientific event, there are different formats for sessions, which can include invited plenary talks and panels, where the spotlight is on particular individuals which represent the community or interested stakeholders.  

In such sessions, prospective organizers should consider having appropriate representation.  In conferences, for example, there are usually multiple invited keynotes.  

## 2. Reserve sufficient time for properly considering ethical considerations and review
